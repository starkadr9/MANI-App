FOCAL GODDESS: Gefjon

This blót is dedicated to the goddess Gefjon, who is identified as being the same as Urðr, the goddess of Fate. She is a powerful deity who, according to Óðinn himself, knows the fate (orlog) of all people.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

This was a significant blót for divination and revelation. The ritual seeks to pierce the veil of the unknown and reveal the threads of fate that weave through mortal lives.

Gefjon possesses the profound wisdom of fate itself, making her the perfect deity to invoke when seeking guidance about the future or understanding one's destiny.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

Historical accounts describe a ritual where a petitioner makes an offering before Gefjon's idol, asking her to reveal his fate and destiny. After the offering, the petitioner sleeps on a sacred animal skin to receive a prophetic vision from the goddess.

This practice of incubation - sacred sleep for divine dreams - connects the worshipper directly to the realm of the gods.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this rite is Revelation (Vísa), which counteracts the Need of Concealment (Fela). Through this ritual, hidden knowledge is brought to light and the mysteries of fate are revealed.

TIMING:

Performed during Sumarmál, when the growing light of summer illuminates not only the physical world but also the hidden realms of knowledge and prophecy.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Gefjonarblót acknowledges that wisdom requires not only strength and courage but also the ability to see beyond the present moment into the deeper patterns that govern existence.

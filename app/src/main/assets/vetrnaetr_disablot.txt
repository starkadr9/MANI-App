DÍSABLÓT
The Goddesses' Blót

FOCAL BEINGS: The Dísir, led by Freyja

The Dísir are the goddesses in Freyja's retinue, with Freyja herself known as the Vanadís ("Dís of the Vanir").

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Dísablót is performed to gain help (Bjarga) from the goddesses, particularly in matters of fertility and childbirth. This sacred rite recognizes the divine feminine power that governs the creation and nurturing of life.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

The power of this blót is reinforced by the Bjargrúnar (birth-helping runes), which are used while praying to the Dísir for aid in labor. These ancient symbols bridge the gap between the mortal and divine realms.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this rite is Fertility (Barnbær), which stands in direct opposition to the Need of Infertility. Through this ritual, the community seeks to ensure the continuation of life and the prosperity of future generations.

SACRED SPACE:

This blót is often conducted in a specific "Hall of the Dísir" (Disarsalr), a dedicated sacred space that honors the divine feminine.

TIMING:

Held during the Vetrnætr feast as part of the sacred trilogy of Winter Nights rituals.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Dísablót acknowledges the essential role of the divine feminine in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth that governs both the natural world and human existence.

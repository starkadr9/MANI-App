The Chief-Blót of Vetrnætr
--

FOCAL GOD: Freyr

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Freysblót is the "Chief-Blót" (Hofuðblót) of the Vetrnætr festival, serving as the central ritual of Winter Nights. This sacred rite is dedicated to the god Freyr, lord of prosperity and peace.

The central purpose of Freysblót is to pray for "ár ok friðr" - meaning a "good harvest/year and peace." This ritual focuses on securing peace through prosperity and wealth, domains that fall under Freyr's divine governance.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing (Bjarga) sought through this blót is Financial Peace (Fégrið), which serves as a powerful counterforce to the Need (Nauð) of Poverty and Hunger.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:

According to the lore, this rite was established as an annual feast by Hadding to appease the gods after he had committed a grievous crime. The ritual thus carries both the weight of tradition and the power of redemption.

TIMING:

Performed during the first three nights of winter, marking the beginning of the new year known as Ar.

SIGNIFICANCE:

As the chief ritual of Vetrnætr, Freysblót sets the spiritual tone for the entire winter season, ensuring that the community enters the dark months with divine protection against want and strife.

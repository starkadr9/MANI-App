ÞÓRRABLÓT
The Thunder God's Blót
--

FOCAL GOD: Þórr (Thor)

Originally believed to have been called Þórsblót, this powerful rite is dedicated to Þórr, the mighty god of thunder and protection.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

This blót is performed "in the middle of winter for a good crop." Þórr presides over the weather and crops, wielding his mighty hammer Mjölnir to ensure the fertility of the land and the prosperity of the harvest.

Offerings are made to Þórr in times of threatened plague and famine, calling upon his strength to drive away the forces that would harm the community.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this rite is Growth and Good Crops (Gróðrar), standing against the corresponding Need of Famine (Sultr). Through this ritual, the people seek Þórr's protection of their sustenance and livelihood.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

The festival could include a procession (Reið) featuring a cart representing Þórr's chariot, accompanied by his consort, Sif. This ceremonial journey brings Þórr's blessing directly to the community.

TIMING:

Performed during the Jólaveizla, the largest and most joyous festival of the year, celebrating the return of the sun after the darkness of the winter solstice.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Þórrablót embodies the triumph of the gods over the "Powers of Frost," representing the eternal struggle between order and chaos, fertility and barrenness, life and death.

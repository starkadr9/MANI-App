According to the lore, this rite was established as an annual feast by Hadding to appease the gods after he had committed a grievous crime. The ritual thus carries both the weight of tradition and the power of redemption.

TIMING:

Performed during Vetrnætr.

SIGNIFICANCE:

As the chief ritual of Vetrnætr, Freysblót sets the spiritual tone for the entire winter season, ensuring that the community enters the dark months with divine protection against want and strife.

CALENDAR TAG: DISA

FOCAL BEINGS: The Dísir, led by Freyja

The Dísir are the goddesses in Freyja's retinue, with Freyja herself known as the Vanadís ("Dís of the Vanir").

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Dísablót is performed to gain help (Bjarga) from the goddesses, particularly in matters of fertility and childbirth. This sacred rite recognizes the divine feminine power that governs the creation and nurturing of life.

The blessing of this rite is Fertility (Barnbær), which stands in direct opposition to the Need of Infertility. Through this ritual, the community seeks to ensure the continuation of life and the prosperity of future generations.

SACRED SPACE:

This blót is often conducted in a specific "Hall of the Dísir" (Disarsalr), a dedicated sacred space that honors the divine feminine.

TIMING:

Performed during Vetrnætr.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Dísablót acknowledges the essential role of the divine feminine in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth that governs both the natural world and human existence.

ÁLFABLÓT
The Elves' Blót
--

CALENDAR TAG: ALFA

FOCAL BEINGS: The Álfar (Elves)

The Álfar are the mystical beings connected to Freyr, the ruler of Álfheimr, the realm of the elves.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Álfablót is performed to ask for healing from sickness. The Álfar are seen as having a deep relationship with the healing of the human body because they helped create the first human forms, giving them intimate knowledge of mortal flesh and spirit.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

The ritual described in Kormaks Saga involves reddening a hill where the Álfar live with the blood of a bull and making a feast for them with its meat to secure healing. This blood offering and sacred feast creates a bond between the mortal and elven realms.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this blót is Healing (Lækning), which counteracts the Need of Sickness and Plague. Through this rite, the community seeks divine intervention in matters of health and recovery.

SACRED NATURE:

Sources indicate that Álfablót was a private affair, held within a farmhouse during the harvest time of Vetrnætr. This intimate setting reflects the personal nature of healing and the close relationship between the Álfar and individual human welfare.

TIMING:

Performed during Vetrnætr.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Álfablót recognizes the ancient wisdom of the Álfar in matters of health and healing, honoring their role as co-creators of humanity and guardians of physical well-being.

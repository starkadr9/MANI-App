RITUAL PRACTICES:

The ritual involves laying hands on the sónargoltr and making solemn vows to make amends for the past, thereby ensuring a better future. This physical act creates a sacred bond between the individual and their commitment to righteousness.

The ceremony is about balancing one's fate (orlog) and cleansing the air of past mistakes, allowing for spiritual renewal and redemption.

TIMING:

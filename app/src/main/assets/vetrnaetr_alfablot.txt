FOCAL BEINGS: The Álfar (Elves)

The Álfar are the mystical beings connected to Freyr, the ruler of Álfheimr, the realm of the elves.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Álfablót is performed to ask for healing from sickness. The Álfar are seen as having a deep relationship with the healing of the human body because they helped create the first human forms, giving them intimate knowledge of mortal flesh and spirit.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

The ritual described in Kormaks Saga involves reddening a hill where the Álfar live with the blood of a bull and making a feast for them with its meat to secure healing. This blood offering and sacred feast creates a bond between the mortal and elven realms.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this blót is Healing (Lækning), which counteracts the Need of Sickness and Plague. Through this rite, the community seeks divine intervention in matters of health and recovery.

SACRED NATURE:

Sources indicate that Álfablót was a private affair, held within a farmhouse during the harvest time of Vetrnætr. This intimate setting reflects the personal nature of healing and the close relationship between the Álfar and individual human welfare.

TIMING:

Performed during the Vetrnætr season, as the third of the Winter Nights trilogy of rituals.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Álfablót recognizes the ancient wisdom of the Álfar in matters of health and healing, honoring their role as co-creators of humanity and guardians of physical well-being.

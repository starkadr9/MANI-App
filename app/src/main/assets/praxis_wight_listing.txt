Lesser Wights
---

--
Alfar
--
The elves, can refer to nondescript higher Wights below the Gods, also variants can be Dwarves (mischievous divine craftsmen), also can refer to male ancestors. Obviously very unclear what exactly these beings are.

--
Disir
--
Similarly this word plays double duty. It can be used in regard to female Goddesses (the Dis of the Aesir) but it also can relate to female ancestors.

Female psychopomps (beings that guide a spirit to an afterlife), generally attributed to the battle dead being picked to go towards Valhalla (a very niche outcome).

---
Illr – Evil Beings
---

--
Mare
--
From where we get the term nightmare, also associated heavily with the sleep paralysis phenomena. If you've ever had sleep paralysis you've likely literally seen one before.

--
Draugr
--
Unquiet, hateful dead. They are far from the typical Hollywood zombie, and are a dangerous force all Germanic peoples feared, thus they ensured proper burial practices were followed.

--
Jormungandr
--
The world serpent that bounds our material realm. Kills Thor but killed by Thor.

--
Fenrir
--
The malicious wolf, bound by Tyr's sacrifice, released on Ragnarok and kills Odin killed by Vidarr.

--
Loki
--
The betrayer and enemy of the Gods. Deceiver, perpetuator of chaos, and the evil masculine force. Participates in the end of the world. Kills and killed by Heimdallr.

--
Gullveig
--
Thrice burned witch, enemy of the Gods. Similar to Loki a deceiver and perpetuator of chaos, the feminine counterpart. Associated with manipulation, poison, subversion. Catalyst for the primal Aesir-Vanir war.

--
Hrimthurses
--
While all Hrimthurses (frost giants) are Jotnar (giants) not all Jotnar are Hrimthurses. The Hrimthurses are the specifically evil Jotnar associated with chaotic forces and disease.

--
Surtr
--
The horrible fire jotunn, lord of the otherwise unattested fire giants. Destroyer of the universe, harbinger of the end of all things, and wielding a flaming sword. Fights Freyr but the outcome is uncertain. Nonetheless Loki and Surtr destroy the universe and leads to the cycle of existence beginning again.

---
Others
---

--
Norns
--
Uncertain beings, nonetheless three are attested Urdr (past), Verdandi (present), and Skuld (future). Their ability to bind even the Gods to fate imply their otherness as something outside and even more powerful than the Gods.

--
Jotnar
--
At best neutral primal beings, many are the evil Hrimthurses, but a select few are either parents to Gods, or directly honored as Gods themselves. Generally called Giants but they're really similar beings to the Gods just not specifically benevolent as the Gods are.

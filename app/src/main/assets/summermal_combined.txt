SIGRBLÓT
The Victory Blót
--

FOCAL GOD: Óðinn

This is a blót for victory, with Óðinn as the central figure. He is known by names such as Sigrfoðr ("Father of Victory") and is the god who grants strength and success in battle.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The Sigrblót is performed for victory in war, as commanded by Óðinn himself in the Ynglingasaga. This martial rite calls upon the Allfather's wisdom and power to guide warriors to triumph over their enemies.

In the broader sense, this ritual seeks victory not only in physical combat but in all struggles and challenges that face the community.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing sought is Victory (Sigr), which is essential to ward off the Need of Peril (Fallandaforað) - the danger that comes with defeat. Through this rite, the people seek divine favor in all their endeavors.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

A key part of the rite could include a procession honoring Óðinn's spouse Frigg (identified with the goddess Nerthus), during which time peace and quietness are observed. This sacred procession brings the blessing of victory to the entire community.

TIMING:

Performed during Sumarmál.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Sigrblót embodies the Norse warrior spirit and the understanding that victory requires both divine favor and human courage. It celebrates the triumph of order over chaos and the strength needed to protect one's people.

GÓABLÓT
The Martial Peace Blót
--

FOCAL PURPOSE: Martial Peace

This rite is performed for a specific kind of peace, distinct from the other forms of peace sought throughout the year. It is offered for "peace and victory to the king," connecting it to Óðinn's domains.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

The purpose of this blót is to secure martial peace - the cessation of conflict and the establishment of order through strength. This is one of three distinct types of peace prayed for throughout the year:

- Spiritual peace (Jólablót)
- Financial peace (Freysblót)  
- Martial peace (Góablót)

This rite is meant to abate hatred and conflict, transforming the energy of war into the stability of just rule.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing sought is Martial Peace, standing against its opposing Need of War. Through this ritual, the community seeks an end to strife and the establishment of righteous governance.

DIVINE CONNECTION:

While closely connected to Óðinn's domains of war and kingship, this blót recognizes that true victory lies not in endless conflict but in the wisdom to know when and how to make peace.

TIMING:

Performed during Sumarmál.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Góablót represents the Norse understanding that peace is not merely the absence of war, but an active state that must be won and maintained through strength, wisdom, and divine favor.

GEFJONARBLÓT
The Revelation Blót
--

FOCAL GODDESS: Gefjon

This blót is dedicated to the goddess Gefjon, who is identified as being the same as Urðr, the goddess of Fate. She is a powerful deity who, according to Óðinn himself, knows the fate (orlog) of all people.

PURPOSE AND MEANING:

This was a significant blót for divination and revelation. The ritual seeks to pierce the veil of the unknown and reveal the threads of fate that weave through mortal lives.

Gefjon possesses the profound wisdom of fate itself, making her the perfect deity to invoke when seeking guidance about the future or understanding one's destiny.

RITUAL PRACTICES:

Historical accounts describe a ritual where a petitioner makes an offering before Gefjon's idol, asking her to reveal his fate and destiny. After the offering, the petitioner sleeps on a sacred animal skin to receive a prophetic vision from the goddess.

This practice of incubation - sacred sleep for divine dreams - connects the worshipper directly to the realm of the gods.

BLESSING AND NEED:

The blessing of this rite is Revelation (Vísa), which counteracts the Need of Concealment (Fela). Through this ritual, hidden knowledge is brought to light and the mysteries of fate are revealed.

TIMING:

Performed during Sumarmál.

SIGNIFICANCE:

The Gefjonarblót acknowledges that wisdom requires not only strength and courage but also the ability to see beyond the present moment into the deeper patterns that govern existence.
